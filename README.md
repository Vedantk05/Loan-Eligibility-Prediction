# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on applicant data. The dataset contains various features, including demographic details, income, and loan attributes. The goal is to create a model that can effectively classify loan applications as eligible or ineligible.

## Features
The dataset includes the following key features:
- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier for loans (excluded from analysis).
- **ApplicantIncome**: Income of the applicant.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Income of the co-applicant.
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount requested.
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of the loan in months.
- **Credit_History**: Credit history of the applicant (1 for good, 0 for bad).
- **Dependents**, **Education**, **Married**, **Self_Employed**, etc.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-eligibility-prediction.git
   cd loan-eligibility-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Loan eligibility prediction.ipynb"
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset by following the instructions in the notebook.
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning and transforming features.
3. Train the machine learning model provided in the notebook.
4. Evaluate the model using the metrics outlined in the notebook.
5. Use the model for predictions on new data.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates key metrics for model evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
